
1.	A “System” consists of “Components” and “Functions”. How would you describe a “Component” and a “Function” of a “System” in the “Automotive World”? Is a “System” okay if all its “Components” and “Functions are okay?
Answer:  
a)	
i)	Component – A physical element used as part of a system (Eg. Injector)
ii)	Function – The task performed by one or more components together (Eg. Injection)
b) No. A System can still be faulty even if all the Components and Functions are okay. The interaction between individual components and functions can lead to errors/failures of the system

2.	What stands the abbreviation “EDC” for? What’s the purpose of this “System”?
Answer:  
-	EDC: “Electronic Diesel Control”. 
-	Purpose: To meter, distribute and disperse the fuel supplied to the Engine (based on several input parameters (Ex. Throttle input, Engine speed, etc.) 

3.	Name and briefly describe the main 4 engineering “EDC” fields
Answer:  
The four main engineering EDC fields are 
i)	System Development
ii)	Components (Hardware)
iii)	Components (Software)
iv)	Application (Calibration)

4.	The “EDC” is an electronic System. Why we use nowadays such an electronic system and not a mechanical system in the automotive world?
Answer:  
-	Increasingly stringent emission regulations and fuel economy requirements 
-	So, constant need to improve the Diesel fuel supply system. 
-	Mechanical systems - inherent limitations in speed, precision and mechanical dependency, were not suitable to meet these requirements. 
-	So, the “Electronic Diesel Control” systems were introduced. 
-	With EDC system, possible to 
o	achieve improved fuel atomization
o	respond faster to the dynamic operating conditions of Engine 
o	achieve the desired state with higher precision. 
o	Overall effect, this leads to reduced fuel consumption and vehicle emissions.
-	Also, in a Mechanical system the exponential efforts for higher functionality. 
-	However, Electronic systems proportional efforts for more functions




5.	What are the differences in the illustrations of the “p-V-diagram” and the “p-a-diagram”?
Answer:  
-	p-V diagram – cylinder pressure & valve events over stroke volume 
o	Represents WM (Indicated work) and WG (Gas Exchange work)
-	p-a-diagram – cylinder pressure & valve events shown over crank angle (2 revs of crankshaft)

6.	Why is the specific fuel consumption of diesel engines smaller than the specific fuel consumption of gasoline engines?
Answer:  
-	Diesel - Nominal operating range - ?>1 (lean mixture) most cases
-	Gasoline – Nominal operating range – around stoichiometric ?=1 bandwidth (0.7 to 1.3)
-	Also, Efficiency of a diesel engine (40% or more) > gasoline engine (~30%)
-	So, the specific fuel consumption of Diesel < Specific fuel consumption of Gasoline
